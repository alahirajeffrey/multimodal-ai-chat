## MultiModal AI Chat Application

### Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly using containers.
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) lets you transform Python scripts into interactive web apps in minutes, instead of weeks. Build dashboards, generate reports, or create chat apps.

**NB** A few quantized models would be downloaded and used locally for this project. The models and links to download the models would be added to the requirements as they are used.
